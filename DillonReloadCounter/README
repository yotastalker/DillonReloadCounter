This is my first upload to GitHub, so it's a learning process for me.

This project is based around a bullet reloader from Dillonprecision.com. I reload my own bullets at home to save some money and it's pretty fun too. For years now I've beenI thought of this project because I have an interest in tinkering with all things, microcontrollers(arduino's and raspi's) so I decided I should make a counter of some sort to count each bullet the machine makes onto and LCD display.
